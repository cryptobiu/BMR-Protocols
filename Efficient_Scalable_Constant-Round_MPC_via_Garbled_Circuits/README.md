Efficient Scalable Constant-Round MPC via Garble Circuits

Implementation of the online computation of the semi-honest secure constant round protocols in the paper "Efficient Scalable Constant-Round MPC via Garbled Circuits" by Aner Ben-Efraim, Yehuda Lindell, and Eran Omri, Asiacrypt 2017.

There are three folders for the three protocols compared in the paper:

1. BMROnline- contains the code for the online computation of the BMR code of "Optimizing Secure Multiparty Computation for the Internet" paper by Aner Ben-Efraim, Yehuda Lindell, and Eran Omri, ACM CCS 2016.

2. DDHbasedBMROnline- contains the code using key homomorphic PRFs based on DDH in quadratic residues group of a large safe prime.

3. LWEbasedBMROnline- contains the code based on ring-LWE.

The instructions to compile and execute each protocol, detailed in each folder separately
